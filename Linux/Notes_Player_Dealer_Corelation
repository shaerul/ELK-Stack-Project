Summary of the Lucky Duck Casino Loss Incidence
===============================================

As per the given data, analyzing on both Player, Dealer and Loss on suspected 10,12 and 15th
of March it has been revealed that,

There were 13 number of losses incurred following a specific time pattern in each day,

05:00:00 AM
08:00:00 AM
02:00:00 PM
08:00:00 PM
11:00:00 PM

In each loss case a common player was always there. His name is Mylie Schmidt.

Further drilling on Primary Dealerâ€™s schedule on Lucky Duck's Roulette Table Game
on the aforesaid three dates 10, 12 and 15 March, there was always only one dealer in
each of the five times, that is Billy Jones.

Having said that, In three days, Mylie Schmidt played 19 times and won a total 13 times.
His winning rate is 68.42% which is very unusual statistics for Roulette Table Game winning.
In his 6 lost cases (in a 4AM & 3PM time pattern) the dealer was Cleveland Hanna. But in each winning case his dealer was always Billy Jones.

On the other hand, Billy Jones was involved in a total 15 Roulette Table games in three days.
13 games were won through player Mylie Schmidt. Remaining two lost games took place on
15th March (08PM and 11PM) were not played by Mylie Schmidt.

So the record says Mylie Schmidt without Billy Jones and Billy Jones without Mylie Schmidt
could not make a single win in three days.

In the light of above analysis, Rogue player seems to be Mylie Schmidt and the rogue dealer
seems to be Billy Jones. From all these evidences the conclusion can be drawn that both of
them colluded to scam Lucky Duck.
