 - List all the types of downloaded files that have been identified for the last 7 days, along with a short description of each file type (use Google if you aren't sure about a particular file type).

   - _`Blank`_ - These are not well known type file downloads

3. Now that you have a feel for the data, Let's dive a bit deeper. Look at the chart that shows Unique Visitors Vs. Average Bytes.
   - Locate the time frame in the last 7 days with the most amount of bytes (activity).
    - **Avg Bytes:** 9,000 (Approximately)
    - **Unique Visitor(s):** 2

   - In your own words, is there anything that seems potentially strange about this activity?
     - **The graph shows that only one visitor appeared during this time compared with other occasions. This may be indicative of a user who might be conducting some sort of malicious activity. Further research is required to rule out an incidence of false positives.**

4. Filter the data by this event.
  - What is the timestamp for this event?
    - **Timestamp for the Spike:** 2021-06-27 07:36:55 (precisely with unique user count 1)
